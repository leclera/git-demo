Spider-man, Spider-man
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves, just like flies
Look out! Here comes the Spider-man!

Is he strong? Listen, Bud!
He’s got radioactive blood.
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead.
Hey there, there goes the Spider-man!

In the chill of night,
At the scene of the crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time

Spider-man, Spider-man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-man
Wealth and fame, he’s ignored
Action is his reward
To him, life is a great big bang-up
Wherever there’s a hang-up
You’ll find the Spider-man!

Lets go to Sarajevo, play a bit of play dough, nothing gonna stop me now I’m
going Yolo.
I’m like a dynamo, give me my own show, I’ve found of way of making difficult
decisions.


Shall I go to the shops? Yolo
Shall I bring my dog? Yolo
Shall I go to the moon? Yolo
Shall I do it soon? Yolo
Shall I kiss the girl? Yolo
Shall I give her a pearl? Yolo
Shall I climb the tree? Yolo
